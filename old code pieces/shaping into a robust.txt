Tre’, this is shaping into a robust governance interface—like a mission control panel for your UFAAN topology. You're defining a scalable, modular system with both visualization and configuration baked in. Let’s break it down and sketch out how each panel could function cleanly:

---

## 🎛️ Panel 1: Interface View ("Control & Inspect")

This panel is data-driven and user-friendly—great for selecting and analyzing individual **deviants** across altitude bands.

### 🔹 Visible Fields
- **Iteration Selector**: Dropdown or file picker pointing to a CSV array of deviants
- **Deviant List**: Scrollable dropdown built from CSV entries (e.g. `D001`, `D002`, `D003`)
- **Deviant Metadata Display** (auto-populated on selection):
  - X, Y, Z (or Lat/Lon/Alt)
  - Thickness (altitude band size)
  - Heading / Enforced Direction (in degrees)
  - SAD & ARZ Status Flags
  - Speed Tier
  - Closest Emergency Band
  - SVN Pitch
  - Optional: dynamic cross-section graphic of stacked bands at given location

### 📈 Visual Output (Suggested)
- A **live cross-sectional graphic overlay** showing vertical slices at the deviants’ coordinates
- Highlighted selected band with surrounding bands in faded layers
- Tooltips on hover for quick comparison

---

## 🛠️ Panel 2: Build Interface ("Forge New Iterations")

This panel enables structured input to populate new `deviant` entries and export them as CSV.

### 🔹 Input Fields for New Deviants
- Map Location (click-to-drop or coordinate entry)
- Band Thickness
- Direction (manual or calculated)
- Status Flags: SAD, ARZ
- Speed Tier selection
- Emergency Band proximity (auto-calculated from other layers?)
- Pitch / Bearing logic
- Notes, labels, version marker

### 🧮 Export Logic
- "Add Deviant to Iteration" → Appends to current CSV array in memory
- "Save Iteration" → Triggers CSV export
- (Optional) "Create System" → Bundle multiple iterations into a system folder
- Future: “Generate Work Group” to compile systems under one THR Framework header

## 🧠 Smart Scaling Logic

You're architecting with modularity in mind, and that opens up advanced possibilities:
- Real-time validation (e.g. no overlap between altitude bands)
- Auto-indexing of deviants
- Visual clustering of systems across terrain
- Searchable filters (by tier, status, location proximity)

If you're ready, I can help scaffold the HTML structure for the new control panel, or sketch the CSV schema to support this tiered data logic. It’s exciting to see your UFAAN concepts evolve into a full framework—this could become a powerful modeling and governance dashboard. Want to rough out the cross-section graphic logic next? Or architect the build form fields for each deviant?
